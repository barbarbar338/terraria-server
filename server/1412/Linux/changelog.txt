Version 1.4.1.2 Changes -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Changes and Adjustments
- Localization should now be updated to fully include 1.4.1 content. Special thanks to Criddle and Midnaait for additional contributions in regards to localization changes!
- Reverted Town NPC House/Village check distance increase. This was doubled in 1.4.1, and has now been returned to 1.4 levels.
- NPC Happiness now gives the "Space" bonus for 3-NPC towns. Previously, there was neither a bonus nor a penalty at 3 NPCs, but this was perceived as a penalty, so its been changed.
- Skeletron Prime's bombs now explode on Planter Boxes (like they were changed to do on Platforms)
- Capes now show when sitting or riding mounts. This was previously limited due to conflicts, but feedback indicated it was worth the potential awkwardness at times to have the option.
- Queen Slime's minions can now drop Slime Staff at normal drop rates
- Clicking anywhere on the creative/bestiary menu will pause searching. This should make the UI more intuitive and result in being accidentally "stuck" in the textbar less common.
- Updated Timeless Traveler sprites, as the sprites being used were accidentally out of date versions
- Spectre Goggles no longer override helmets entirely, as they are not full head accessories and were not meant to do so

II. Bug Fixes:
- Attempting a music-related fix for an issue where users cannot increase their music volume above 0%. This may also potentially fix some seemingly unrelated launch crashes which actually stem from the same root issue.
- Fixed an issue with Happiness values that was causing them to round down heavily, negating minor differences and making it harder to reach certain thresholds.
- Fixed an issue where the Crowded penalty for only 1 NPC was acting like there were 2 extra NPCs, making it start more severely than intended
- Fixed a back-end issue that prevented the Chinese localization for 1.4 being added to the game correctly
- Fixed an issue where the Ronin set would not show fireflies on a female character
- Fixed an issue where player skin became much brighter under some circumstances, such as using some Light Pets
- Fixed another syncing issue with Cracked Dungeon bricks, which should resolve the teleporting enemies in Dungeons
- Fixed an issue where increasing time rate in Journey mode would make the Credits run very fast on the main menu
- Fixed an issue where certain parts of the credits roll did not support texture packs and could result in a crash
- Fixed Life Drain not costing mana to use in PVP
- Fixed a fault in the Prismatic Lacewing sprite file that caused severe issues for a small minority of Linux users
- Fixed Princess discussing bosses/threats that hadn't been defeated yet
- Fixed Princess's party hat not being on her head correctly
- Fixed Video Visage's screen being offset when in reverse gravity
- Fixed an issue where some Vanity ears would show the back-ear in the wrong position when sitting
- Fixed an issue where Tail accessories did not adjust their height correctly when sitting
- Fixed an issue where certain hairs would "draw double" when sitting
- Fixed a wide variety of NPC Dialogue, Bestiary, and Item Flavor Text grammatical/spelling/punctuation issues.
- Fixed an issue with Town NPCs not teleporting into very tall/thin homes at night, or houses where chairs did not have sufficient space
- Fixed Tall Hats having visual issues when riding a mount
- Fixed a visual framing issue with the Bamboo Lantern
- Fixed an issue where Stardust Guardian was no longer transparent when dyed
- Fixed an issue where some critters would super jump while underwater
- Fixed an issue where NPCs and Cats would sit in the same seat at night
- Fixed an issue where Vanity Rocket Boot trails were inconsistently prioritized and not always showing the correct trail
- Fixed an issue where Bones were still flagged as Ammo
- Fixed an issue where Lunar Drills/Chainsaws were getting prefixes they shouldn't
- Fixed an issue where the game did not Autopause in the Achievements menu
- Fixed a sell value inconsistency introduced by 1.4.1's crafting cost change for Adamantite/Titanium Ore bars
- Fixed an issue where Gamepad Master Mode slot visibility toggle did not work properly
- Jousting Lances can no longer receive melee speed prefixes. They already could not benefit from Melee speed, but this fixes some bugs caused by Melee speed modifiers that impacted them.
- Fixed an unusual exploit allowing you to force-teleport other players
- Fixed some stat inaccuracies where several OOA armor's stats did not match their tooltips. Also made a few text adjustments to clarify specific damage types.
- Fixed an issue where Hero's Shield was not giving its aggro boost
- Fixed a minor visual issue with Tinkerer's Workshop where some of its pixels were not visible
- Fixed Sky Dragon's Fury not animating when thrown on the ground
- Fixed Sky Dragon's Fury's secondary fire not inflicting Flask debuffs
- Fixed an issue where Souls in a Bottle were missing animation frames
- Fixed an issue where Hair 6 and Hair 94 had a conflict with capes
- Fixed an issue where Credits would scroll when paused
- Town NPCs will only fire on enemies if that enemy can be targetted (ideally, no more Plantera Hooks and the like)
- Fixed some inefficiency in Minion targetting that had performance impacts
- Fixed some exploits/oversight related to Bee Hives, Bunny Cannons, and Antlion Eggs
- Fixed an issue with enemy Bees attacking invincible enemies
- Fixed an issue where scrolling through Character Difficulty modes with Gamepad or WASD would follow a backwards order
- Fixed a handful of item drop rates that were not properly affected by luck (mostly some OOA drops). Will not impact actual drop rates to much of a substantial degree.
- Fixed an issue with a few leaf sprites that caused them to not correctly handle paint
- Fixed an issue where most falling tile projectiles would fall through platforms, except for regular Sand. All of them now land on the platform, except hostile Sand ball projectiles.
- Fixed an issue where some large texture items would scale down twice in chat
- Fixed an issue where Reaper Hood's head texture had an offset frame
- Fixed an issue where Robot Shirt worked with "hand" accessories, since its hands were incompatible with them. Robot Shirt and Pumpkin Shirt now do not work with Belt accessories either, for the same reason.
- Fixed an issue where some texture sizes weren't updated in the code, which prevented texture packs of those sprites from working properly
- Fixed an issue where the Paper Airplane projectile wasn't considered Ranged
- Fixed an issue where Molotov Cocktail didn't gain Frost Armor's Frostburn debuff
- Fixed an issue where Coin Gun would not prioritize Coin slots over Inventory slots

- Fixed an issue where Paper Airplanes weren't correctly dropping in stacks

III. Balance Changes:

Melee
Brand of the Inferno
- Use time decreased from 25 to 20 in light of recent buffs to similar tier weapons

Chlorophyte Claymore
- Increased damage from 80 to 95 in light of recent buffs to similar tier weapons

Chlorophyte Saber
- Increased damage from 48 to 57 in light of recent buffs to similar tier weapons

Christmas Tree Sword
- Projectiles now deal 75% of the base damage instead of 50%

Ranged
Super Star Shooter
- Reduced use time from 12 to 18 (THIS IS NOT A NERF!)
- Reduced damage from 70 to 60 (BEAR WITH ME, ITS NOT A NERF)
- Note: Due to immune frame time, this will actually result in more consistent damage, and is actually a buff. The damage decrease was required to offset the significantly increased damage.

Magic
Betsy's Wrath
- Partially reverting damage buff from 1.4.1, reducing damage from 110 to 100

Summons
Hornet Staff
- Increased damage from 11 to 12 (building upon the initial increase in 1.4.1 from 9 to 11)

Vampire Frog Staff
- Reverting damage buff from 1.4.1, reducing damage from 13 to 11. The AI/functionality changes from 1.4.1 have been more than sufficient on their own, and the extra damage was unneeded.

Obsidian Armor
- Reduced the Minion damage bonus on the helmet and legs from 9% to 8% each
- Reduced the Minion damage increase on the set bonus from 25% to 15%
- Reduced the Whip speed increase on the set bonus from 50% to 35%

Spider Staff
- Summoning Spiders will now attempt to systematically summon the different types of spiders in order, rather than randomly. Due to immune frame schenanigans, this may result in more consistent damage, though it does not actually increase the maximum potential of the weapon.

Optic Staff
- Enemy immune frames caused by Spazmamini and Retinamini attacks have been reduced from 16 to 12
- Increased Spazmamini's movement speed while pursuing enemies

Deadly Sphere Staff
- Enemy immune frames caused by Deadly Sphere attacks have been reduced from 10 to 8

Firecracker
- Reduced explosion proc damage from 3x of minion base damage to 2.75x

Cool Whip
- Cool Whip now inflicts Frostburn a short duration on hit
- Increased the movement speed of the Snowflake minion by 50%

Desert Tiger
- Now "bounces on" its current target if that target is in the air, staying more firmly latched on and dealing damage
- Increased scaling damage per "minion slot" expended slightly (from 33% of base damage to 40% of base damage)

Rainbow Crystal Staff
- Partially reverting the damage reduction in 1.4, increasing its damage from 80 to 130

Mounts/Wings/Accessories
Celestial Starboard
- Made some adjustments to improve its handling, while still keeping the fix that made sure that Starboard got full dash distance

Star Cloaks
- Only creates stars now when taking damage from enemy sources

Black Spot
- Slightly increased acceleration, to slightly offset for the loss of overall speed in 1.4.1

Crafting Recipes
Chlorophyte Bars
- Reduced crafting recipe from 6 to 5 ore per bar

Chlorophyte Bullets
- Reduced crafting efficiency from 70 bullets per bar to 60 bullets per bar (to roughly maintain parity with the Bar crafting cost change)

Enemy Immunities:
Snow Flinx - Removed their Poison immunity
Wall of Flesh - Removed its Poison immunity
Queen Bee - Added Poison immunity
Morning Wood - Added Poison immunity
Twins - Added Poison immunity
Martian Probes - Added Poison immunity
Granite Golem/Elemental - Added On Fire/Hellfire immunity
Betsy - Added On Fire/Hellfire immunity
Frozen Zombies - Added Frostburn Immunity
Clingers - Added Cursed Inferno Immunity
Dark Mage Skeletons - Added Poison immunity

Version 1.4.1 Changes -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Terraria 1.4.1 New Content and Content Changes:

A. New Content and Changes
	Added the winners of the Terraria Vanity Contest:
		Plaguebringer
		Wandering Ronin
		The Timeless Traveler
		Floret Protector
		Capricorn
		Bonus winner: TV Head!
		All six of these are craftable with pre-Hardmode materials of various sorts, so that all players can experience these awesome vanity sets! Thanks to everyone who participated and voted in the Vanity contest, and especially to our winners!
	Added new Achievements
	Added a credit sequence and music track following Moon Lord's defeat for the first time. This can also be accessed from the main menu.
	Music Box (Journey's End) is now created by recording the Credits music sequence. Additionally, using it in a normal accessory slot will play the Credits in-game, while using it in a social slot will only play the music.
	Added a new Princess NPC, with a variety of related items (and a new hairstyle!)
	Added new early game Summon equipment: Flinx Fur Coat and the Flinx Staff!
	Added a new pre-Hardmode whip, craftable at Dungeon-tier
	Added a Lavaproof Fishing Hook + Angler Tackle Bag Tinker
	Bee Hives and Antlion Eggs can now be crafted and placed
	Added a "Rainbow Cursor" vanity accessory

B. Vanity Accessory Changes
	Ultrabright Helmet now supports visible hair when worn
	Armors and vanity items which draw on the back (backpacks, tails, wings, and capes) are now no longer mutually exclusive. This means that you can now have one of any of those four categories all displaying at the same time. Previously, only one of those could ever be visible at a time (for instance, if you had visible wings, you could not ever see a cape, backpack, or tail).
	Combat Wrench now displays on the player regardless of what other backpacks are currently shown (it is its own category of back-draw)
	Angel Halo now functions like Unicorn Horn, in that it will be visible regardless of any other head equipment or vanity that is equipped
	Accessories which draw on the head have also been split into several subgroups, which will allow several of them to be worn simultaneously. For example, Blindfold/Spectre Goggles in the eye slot, Nature's Gift/Obsidian Rose in the "flower" slot and Ginger Beard.
	Blindfold can now be visibly seen when wearing hats/helmets which show the face
	Wearing Diving Helmet-series accessories set to visible will override your helmet, allowing them to be seen instead of your helmet
	Obsidian Skull-series accessories that are set to visible are now compatible with hats/helmets that show the face, as it will replace your face with the skull. Due to the shape of the Skull not fitting standard "Terrarian face" shapes, on certain helmets, it will use a different sprite with a more standard layout. You can also wear virtually all physically compatible Head/Face accessories with the Obsidian Skull as well.
	Ginger Beard has been resprited, and if set to visible, is now compatible with hats/helmets that show the face. It is also now compatible with most other Head/Face accessories.
	Reworked Shield/Cape display so that Shields and Capes are now visually compatible with each other again. The Shield now draws "in front" of the Cape, instead of underneath of it, which led to many of the initial issues.
	Shields which are set to not be visible can still be dyed, and will show that dye when actively used (such as Shield of Cthulhu dash or Brand of the Inferno Block). Previously, if they were set to invisible, their active use version would never have dye.
	Long-player hair is now properly compatible with wings/backpacks, and will show the full length of the hair without being cut-off visually
	The special trails left by various types of running boots (Sailfish, Flurry, Flower, etc) are now also subject to vanity usage, and you can use the one you prefer either through re-ordering accessories or using the social slots
	Bone Glove now has visual vanity for the hand slot

C. Other Content/Design Changes
	The Journey Mode duplication menu has been overhauled, with the addition of several new filters to break up some of the larger categories
	Additionally, the Misc option in the duplication menu should more properly encompass items that do not fall under any other category
	Made minor updates to Boss Mask item sprites to match the mask sprites
	Sprite update for Orange/Amber Phasesaber
	Torch God now plays an Otherworldly track when that setting is toggled
	Bestiary now indicates if a drop is Wave-based/if it only drops after a certain wave in Frost Moon and Pumpkin Moon
	Loading Tips now appear when connecting to a server
	Thunder volume is now adjusted with the Ambient SFX settings rather than regular Sound settings (edited)
	Plantero's Sombrero has made its triumphant return
	Reorganized menu settings for resolution/fullscreen/windowed borderless to all use the same sub-menu, to reduce confusion
	Updated FNA (Mac/Linux related)
	Added RGB support for SteelSeries game peripherals
	Adding updated localization for all languages up to 1.4 (some 1.4.1 content may still be untranslated, and these translations will come in an upcoming hotfix)

II. Terraria 1.4.1 Bug Fixes:

A. Major Issues and Crashes

This may require reinstalling Terraria to fix, if it is causing said issues, as Steam does not automatically replace the files just due to capitalization, and we have not found a way to force it to do so.
	Fixed an issue where the favorites file could not support some characters and symbols in world/player names

H. Server Issues/Multiplayer Specific Issues
	Fixed an issue where generating a world with the dedicated server would not respect the length limits of world names/seeds
	Fixed an issue where generating a world with the dedicated server would not properly work with special seeds
	Fixed an issue where worlds generated from the dedicated server were sometimes corrupt (unplayable, not the biome) on creation
	Fixed an oversight allowing you to set maxPlayers to over 255 or under 1 with the server config
	The Liquid Spam setting should now properly increment up to a kick, instead of instantly kicking a player when they place any liquid
	Fixed an issue where the server would endlessly try to shove items into the player's pockets if they don't pick the items up
	Fixed an issue where spawn points on the very rightmost edge of a map not functioning properly in Multiplayer


III. Terraria 1.4.1 Balance Changes

A. Melee Weapons

	Terra Blade and the True Swords Tier/Source
	Terra Blade and the True Swords have been somewhat overhauled in both crafting and function. Note: Mothron now only spawns after Plantera. As a result, the Broken Hero Sword is post-Plantera only.

	True Night's Edge
	Projectile damage now does 1.5x of the base damage
	Is now autoswing
	Is now crafted with the Night's Edge + some of all 3 boss souls. No longer requires a Broken Hero Sword.

	True Excalibur
	Increased damage from 66 to 70

	Brand of the Inferno
	Scale increased from 1.15f to 1.3f (this makes the sword itself larger)

	Now ignores up to 20 enemy defense

	Chain Guillotine
	Damage increased from 43 to 59

	Increased hit radius/size of the attack by 35%

	Flying Dragon
	Damage increased from 90 to 180.

	Sky Dragon's Fury
	Damage increased from 70 to 140
	Projectile damage decreased from 75% of base damage to 50% of base damage. This means instead of doing 52 (75% of 70) it will do 70 (50% of 140)

	Starlight
	Damage increased from 70 to 80
	Now has a bonus critical chance of 10%

	Quad-Barreled Shotgun

	Cursed Bullets
	Increased speed to match Ichor Bullets
	Also, see Debuffs section for details of Cursed Inferno changes

	Reworked the immunity time system of Meteor Shot so rapid fire/shotgun-type weapons using it are unlikely to result in bullets missing due to immune frames

	High Velocity Bullets
	Damage increased from 10 to 11
	Projectile now pierces twice, hitting up to 3 enemies
	Applies a 15% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy a projectile pierces

	Nettle Burst
	Now ignores up to 10 enemy defense

	Wasp Gun
	Wasps now ignore up to 10 enemy defense

	Razorblade Typhoon
	Previously, this weapon fired two projectiles for every use, consuming mana only once. Now it only fires one projectile for the same mana cost and use time.
	However, that projectile now deals 50% more (increased from 60 to 90)

	Magical Harp
	Damage increased from 32 to 42
	Knockback increased from 0 to 0.25 (in other words, it now has knockback)
	Mana cost increased from 4 to 5
	Applies a 5% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy a projectile pierces

	Blood Thorn
	Damage increased from 29 to 34

		Cool Whip's damage penalty is reduced from 33% to 30%
		Durendal's damage penalty is reduced from 30% to 20%
		Morning Star's damage penalty is reduced from 25% to 5% (due to its heavy hitting nature, it's almost absent)
		Dark Harvest's damage penalty is reduced from 30% to 10%
		Kaleidoscope's damage penalty is reduced from 15% to 10%

	Whip Range
	Every whip (except for Leather Whip) has had a range increase
	This increase is the smallest with earlier whips (Snapthorn only roughly 10% longer) and larger with later whips (several late game whips have a roughly 50% increase)

	Whips + Flasks
	Whips can now gain the benefits of Flask buffs

	Leather Whip
	Is now purchasable from the Zoologist at 10% completion instead of 15%, as 15% too often left it more efficient to just sequence break to the Jungle to obtain Snapthorn

	Finch Staff
	Finch should now be somewhat more reliable/accurate with hitting its targets. However, due to how early it is obtained, it is intentionally a little inaccurate, as this is part of its balancing.
	Enemies knocked back by Finches should almost always be knocked away from the player now, regardless of the angle of the Finch

	Optic Staff
	Technically a bug, but Retinamini's lasers were accidentally not set to use independent immunity timers, which meant that they were still conflicting with other piercing attacks, while the 1.4 changelog had indicated otherwise. This has been fixed, which should result in less immune-frame time for Retinamini lasers.

	Sanguine Staff
	The attack speed of Sanguine Bats has been increased from 60 to 66 (this is how long it takes to make their attack circuit)

	Xeno Staff
	Fire rate cooldown increased from 30 to 33 (roughly 10% slower attack speed)

	Tempest Staff
	Fire rate cooldown decreased from 60 to 50 (roughly 20% faster attack speed)
	Projectile Speed of the Sharkrons increased from 14 to 20
	Movement speed of the Tempests themselves increased by 50%, so they can chase after enemies more quickly

	Hornet Staff
	Damage increased from 9 to 11

	Vampire Frog Staff
	Damage increased from 11 to 13
	Enemies can now be damaged by their entire body, not just the tongue, when they are attacking
	Like with Optic Staff, this was technically a bug, but Vampire Frogs were not set to use independent immunity timers like most other minions. This has been remedied, so they should no longer interfere with other piercing projectiles.

	Pygmy Staff
	Projectile speed increased from 12 to 18 (with additional adjustments made to their fall rate to keep it consistent)
	Increased the range at which Pygmies will fire their spears by roughly 40%

	Desert Tiger Staff
	Base damage increased from 33 to 41
	Hitbox size while using the special attack increased to reduce the situations where it misses while using it

	Frost Hydra Staff
	Projectile now pierces twice, hitting up to 3 enemies
	Applies a 15% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy a projectile pierces

	For more information about changes to the Oiled debuff, see the Buff/Debuff section

	Kaleidoscope
	Damage increased from 165 to 180

	Obsidian Greaves now give 9% Summon damage
	New Set bonus: Increase Whip Range and Speed by 50%. Additionally, gain another 25% Summon damage (43% total across the entire set)
	Note: This set will deal very high summon damage, but at the expense of a lower minion count. Instead, it focuses on dramatically improving the performance and damage of whips, and can still be obtained earlier, or as an alternative, to Bee Armor, but it may require a bit more legwork to obtain the set, given its new crafting station requirement.

	Molten Armor
	Molten Helmet now gives 7% Melee Critical Chance
	Molten Breastplate now gives 7% Melee Damage
	Molten Leggings now give 7% Melee Speed
	The 17% Melee Damage set bonus has been reduced to 10% (the 7% moved to the Breastplate)

	The "recovery rate" that determines how many new projectiles can be generated over time has increased from 250 to 400 (it was increased from 150 to 250 in 1.4)

	Spectre Armor (Hood)
	Note: Statistically speaking, this set has not changed! This is merely a re-organizing of stat changes and tooltip revision to be more clear to players
	The -40% damage penalty has been moved from the Spectre Hood itself (which now gives no bonuses at all, either positive or negative) and now comes from the Set Bonus
	The tooltip on the set bonus now attempts to be more clear about the fact that you are trading offensive power for healing benefits. Hopefully, this will lead to less confusion in the future about why this set works the way it does.

	Crystal Assassin Armor
	Added 10% Mana Cost reduction to the Hood
	Added 10% Ammo Cost reduction to the Shirt
	Added 10% Melee Speed increase to the Pants

	Increased healing gain from 0.5 HP per second to 1 HP per second

	Band of Starpower/Panic Necklace
	(Cross-listing from Crafting Changes) Band of Starpower and Panic Necklace are now more easily available in all worlds. They can be crafted in a Graveyard at a Tinkerer's Workshop, by taking one of them and combining it with a Life or Mana Crystal. Band of Starpower + Life Crystal = Panic Necklace. Panic Necklace + Mana Crystal = Band of Starpower.

	Bone Glove
	This item has been completely overhauled and turned into an accessory
	When equipped, the player will shoot Crossbones towards their cursor whenever they are attacking, once per second. Consider it like a sword projectile, except it works for every weapon.
	The bones deal 25 class-neutral damage, but additionally ignore up to 25 enemy defense.
	Now also has vanity visibility in the Gloves spot
	Note: In practice, this should allow the Bone Gloves to be simultaneously viable for more classes than just Ranged, and also give it a bit more longevity

	Brain of Confusion

	Reduced the duration of Mind Trick by 1 second

	Celestial Cuffs
	Now has the +20 mana bonus that its component accessories granted

	Titan Glove now has a new perk that increases the size of (eligible) melee weapons by 10%. This perk is also present on all of its tinkers; however, the effect does not stack.

	Fledgling Wings and Lucky Horseshoe
	The Lucky Horseshoe is no longer found in Sky Chests, and has been added to the underground Gold Chest loot pool
	In its place, Fledgling Wings have been added to Sky Chests and Sky Crates

	Flesh Knuckles/Berserker Gloves
	Defense increased from 7 to 8

	Fire Gauntlet

	Additionally, if hit while wearing any of these accessories, the player gains the Honey buff for 5 seconds

	Jellyfish Necklace and all of its tinkers
	Now lets off an extremely faint glow when out of water (less than the Shadow Orb light pet)
	Dramatically increased the brightness when in water

	Lava Charm
	Doubled its spawn rate, giving it a 1/20 chance to be found in Lava-layer chests or Lava fishing crates

	Magma Stone
	Now inflicts a special version of On Fire that deals 15 DPS instead of 4

	Molten Quiver
	Technically a bug fix, but Wooden Arrows converted to Flaming Arrows by using this accessory now properly gain the +2 damage that Flaming Arrows have. This bonus is only applied to Wooden Arrows, if using the Quiver with superior arrows it will not apply the bonus (as it would be using the superior damage bonus of those arrows instead)

	Obsidian Rose
	Increased the lava damage reduction from 30 to 45. This change applies to all of its tinkers, however, as a consequence, lava damage has been moved to its own immunity timer, as the change would allow lava to very easily be reduced to 1 damage with the proper loadout.
	Is now a component in the Lava Waders, extending its lava damage reduction to the Lava Waders, Hellfire Treads, and Terraspark Boots. This change is retroactive for people who have already crafted those items, of course!

	Panic Necklace/Sweetheart Necklace
	Increased duration of the Panic! buff from 5 to 8 seconds

	Pygmy Necklace
	Is now sold by the Witch Doctor in pre-Hardmode, giving summoning accessories some earlier-game accessibility (he still only sells it at night, however!)

	Star Cloak, Bee Cloak, Star Veil, and Mana Cloak
	The base damage of the Stars generated by these accessories has been increased from 30 to 75. In addition, these stars will ignore up to 25 enemy defense.
	This damage is multiplied by 2x in Expert mode, and 3x in Master mode (the defense penetration remains unchanged)
	Now uses local immune frames, will not interfere with other piercing projectiles

	Use time decreased from 18 to 13

	Bone Pickaxe

	Now sold by the Mechanic as soon as she can be rescued, not just in Hardmode
	Is now available every other moon phase, rather than only a single moon phase

	Fiberglass Fishing Pole
	Fishing power increased from 27% to 30%
	Increased odds of finding it in a chest from 1/30 to 1/15

	Scarab Fishing Rod
	Fishing Power increased from 25% to 30%

	Sitting Duck Rod
	The Traveling Merchant will now only sell this after Skeletron has been defeated

	Living Wands
	The Living Wood Wand and Leaf Wand have a 1/300 chance of being dropped from TreeHit purity forest trees, offering a rare but renewable source of them
	The Living Mahogany Wand and Rich Mahogany Leaf Wand have a 1/200 chance of being dropped from TreeHit Jungle Trees

	Black Spot
	Top speed and acceleration decreased dramatically. Previously its top speed was higher than the UFO mount, but now it is less.
	Can no longer dash-into-mount to instantly reach top acceleration

	Scutlix Mount
	There was an unlisted change in 1.4 that dramatically reduced the range of the Scutlix mount's attack. This was a performance change, not a balance change, and cannot be fully reverted as a result.
	However, the reduced range (500) was able to be increased to 850 without reintroducing performance issues.
	Additionally, to compensate for the lost range, the damage of the Scutlix shots has been increased from 100 to 150

	Dark Mage's Tome
	This mount now steps up slopes and 1-block tiles like the Flying Carpet

	Witch's Broom 
	Slightly increased speed values so that it is a minor upgrade over the UFO Mount (since it is Expert exclusive)

	Flamingo Mount
	Top speed decreased from 7.5 to 6

	Pre-Hardmode Horse Mounts (Dusty Rawhide, Royal Gilded, and Black Studded Saddles)
	Top speed increased from 8 to 9

	Brightness increased by roughly 50%

	Suspicious Looking Tentacle (Light Pet)
	Brightness increased by roughly 33%

H. Crafting Recipes and Drops

	Blood Rain Bow, Chum Caster, and Vampire Frog Staff
	Previously, killing a Wandering Eye Fish or a Zombie Merman had a flat 1/8 chance for the game to select ONE of the three items to drop, and it would only drop one. This has been changed so that each of the three items has their own independent 1/8 chance to drop. This means that you could potentially get more than one drop at once, and the three are no longer competing with each other, effectively increasing their drop rate by 3x.

	Bloody Tear

	Blade Staff
	Now drops from Queen Slime instead of Enchanted Swords

	Sturdy Fossil
	Tomb Crawlers now have a chance to drop small amounts of Sturdy Fossil
	Oasis/Mirage Crates now have a chance to include Sturdy Fossil

	Valor/Muramasa and Golden Lock Boxes
	(Technically a bug) fixed an issue where Muramasa had twice the odds of dropping from a Golden Lock Box compared to other items
	Valor can now be found from Golden Lock Boxes

	Torches
	Jungle Torches now have a more efficient recipe, giving more torches per Jungle Spore
	If you have less than 20 torches at any point, you have an increased chance to get torches when breaking pots

	Mana Crystal
	In light of the increased spawn rate of Falling Stars in 1.4, the crafting recipe for Mana Crystals has been increased from 3 to 5 Fallen Stars

	Early Game Ore Tools, Weapons, and Armor
	The cost of making early game Ore equipment has been re-evaluated across the board with cost reductions to most items. This applies to Copper, Tin, Iron, Lead, Silver, Tungsten, Gold, and Platinum
	Pickaxes have had their crafting costs reduced from 12 to 10. Copper/Tin Pickaxes have been reduced to 8.
	Axes have had their crafting costs reduced from 9 to 8. Copper/Tin Axes have been reduced to 6.
	Broadsword crafting costs are generally unchanged, but Copper/Tin Broadswords have been reduced from 8 to 6
	Shortswords have had their crafting costs reduced from 7 to 6. Copper/Tin Shortswords have been reduced to 5.
	Hammers have had their crafting costs reduced from 10 to 8.
	Bows have NOT had their crafting costs changed.
	Copper and Tin Armor's costs (ordered from Helmet>Chest>Legs) have been reduced from 15/25/20 Bars to 12/20/16 Bars
	Iron and Lead Armor's costs have been reduced from 20/30/25 to 15/25/20

	The required bars to craft Adamantite and Titanium Swords has not changed, but see the next section for more info

	Adamantite/Titanium Bars
	The crafting cost of Adamantite/Titanium Bars has been reduced from 5 to 4 Ore. Subsequently, this reduces the cost of all Adamantite/Titanium armor, weapons, and tools

	Jester Arrows
	The crafting efficiency per Fallen Star has been reduced by half. You now get 10 arrows per star rather than 20.

	Super Star Shooter
	Rather than being sold randomly from the Traveling Merchant, this weapon is now crafted with the Star Cannon and Hallowed Bars

I. Buffs/Debuffs

	Frostburn
	"Player" Frostburn now does 8 DPS like "Enemy" Frostburn

	Cursed Inferno
	Technically a bug fix: 1.4 purported to increase Cursed Inferno damage from 12 to 24, but this was in error due to misreading the code. In truth, this was an increase from 6 to 12. This has now been remedied, and Cursed Inferno now properly does 24 DPS. However, player-based Cursed Inferno has NOT been increased correspondingly, so they will still take 12 DPS.

	Venom
	Technically a bug fix: 1.4 purported to increase Venom damage from 12 to 30, but this was in error due to misreading the code. In truth, this was an increase from 6 to 15. This has now been remedied, and Venom now properly does 30 DPS. However, player-based Venom has NOT been increased correspondingly, so they will still take 15 DPS.
	Venom has been renamed to "Acid Venom". This is to reflect a dramatic overhaul to its enemy immunity. Enemies who are immune to Poison are no longer necessarily immune to Acid Venom, and Acid Venom will now usually impact undead, stone, metal, and poisonous enemies.

	Ichor
	Defense reduction has been reduced from 20 to 15

	Oiled
	Rather than individually boosting different OnFire-like debuffs with, admittedly arbitrary amounts, Oiled now adds an additional flat 25 DPS if the target is suffering from any of these debuffs. For example, if the target is On Fire (4 DPS), it will take 29 total if Oiled.

	Thorns Potion
	The Thorns effect from this potion has been increased from 1/3rd of the damage taken to 100% of the damage taken

	Dryad's Blessing
	The Thorns effect from this buff has been increased from 20% of the damage taken to 50% of the damage taken

	Debuff Immunity Overhaul
	Though far too extensive to fully document, hundreds of changes have been made to enemy debuff immunities across the game. Generally speaking, the majority of these changes were making enemies susceptible to debuffs which they were previously immune to.
	The Venom change previously mentioned is the most prominent example, with the vast majority of Venom immune enemies no longer being immune.
	A large number of enemies which were previously immune to Cursed Inferno no longer are, particularly many stone/metal enemies
	Previously, enemies which were immune to Cursed Inferno were also always immune to Shadowflame. This is no longer the case, and there are now enemies immune to one or the other, though on the whole, a lot less enemies are immune to Shadowflame than before
	Ghost-like enemies (Wraiths, Poltergeists, etc) are now almost always immune to all major debuffs, including Ichor. This does not extend to Whip-debuffs.
	A large number of enemies which were "immune to everything" no longer are. This includes several Pumpkin Moon enemies and Celestial Invasion enemies that were immune to everything for no apparent reason. They are now immune, or not immune, to various debuffs depending on their nature.
	Several enemies which are "immune to everything" intentionally (such as the Destroyer) are no longer immune to Whip-debuffs, as those are meant to be universal.
	Though there are a few exceptions, the vast majority of Confusion-immune enemies still are. Unfortunately, this is because Confusion requires specialized code for every type of enemy, and so the cost investment to make more enemies susceptible to Confusion is dramatically higher than simply "setting them to not immune" like the other debuffs.

	Antlion Larvae
	Life decreased from 45 to 35

	Antlion Eggs will now slowly regrow over time, like Bee Hives in the Jungle, but like Bee Hives, only until there are a certain number in an area, to prevent over-saturation

	Rolling Cactus
	Reduced the base boulder damage by about a third, making them slightly less lethal (though still considerably dangerous) threats
	Increased the Cactus Thorn projectile damage from 20 to 30

	Angry Dandelion
	Technically a bug fix: fixed an issue where Angry Dandelion's projectile damage scaled twice, resulting in it doing far more than it should have, especially in Expert/Master

	Rock Golem
	Technically a bug fix: fixed an issue where Rock Golem's projectile damage scaled twice, resulting in it doing far more than it should have, especially in Expert/Master

	The Jungle and Corrupt/Crimson Worldgen
	Worldgen will attempt to avoid overlapping Corruption and Crimson biomes with the Jungle during initial worldgen. While it is possible to still have overlap, the worldgen system will strongly discourage it in general, so expect to see far less worlds with Corrupt/Crimson Jungles. This does not apply to the Hardmode infection strips.

	Armed Zombie/Throwing Skeleton Statues
	These can now be found in worldgen in any world difficulty, and will function normally in those worlds

	Shadow Chests in Worldgen
	Shadow Chests are now more numerous in worldgen, with the limit increasing from 7-10 to 10-15

	Pyramid Rarity
	Worldgen's chance to place Pyramids has been increased by 50%.

	Enchanted Sword Shrines
	Worldgen's chance to place Enchanted Sword Shrines has been doubled (more accurately, each attempt to generate had only a 1/4 chance to succeed, and that has been increased to 1/2)

	The Bone Welder is sold when in a Graveyard, as the Dungeon is no proper home
	Living Looms will be sold if the player is carrying a Living Wood Wand (please see the Tools section about Living Wood Wand renewability)
	The Flesh Cloning Vat and Decay Chamber, while still sold by the Steampunker only in one type of evil world, can be crafted into each other in a Graveyard, with some Souls of Night

	Mirage Fish/Pixie Fish
	Adjusted Mirage Fish and Pixiefish to be "uncommon" instead of "rare", to match other Quest fish

	Mushrooms
	Regular orange mushrooms now have a potion sickness time of 30 seconds, instead of the full 60.

	Fishing Decreasing Returns
	Removed decreasing returns on Fishing Power at high levels.

	Pylons and the Celestial Invasion
	Pylons can now be used during the Celestial Invasion to traverse the world to combat the various pillars. This exception does not include Moon Lord, and they are still unusable during other invasions/boss fights.

	Players in Journey Mode now spawn with the basic Grappling Hook

	Boss Related Bestiary Entries

	Fixed some memory management issues
	Fixed lighting related crash with non-color mode

II. Crash Fixes and Performance Improvements:
	Fixed an issue that caused serious worldgen problems and some crashes for users with Turkish-language PCs (and possibly some other languages as well)
	Users with file permissions crashes should now get an updated error message giving more instructions on the matter (File permissions issues stem from Terraria not being allowed by the PC to make and modify save files, usually causing crashes when saving or making characters/worlds)

	Added some optimization to mannequins and hat racks to decrease their performance toll
	Added some protection against crashing while taking very large Camera mode snapshots
	Reduced liquid movement restrictions in multiplayer, which should translate to more liquid being allowed to move in servers at once
	Improved how multiplayer servers handle liquid syncing

	Team name plates no longer show health when at full health to improve MP performance
	Added a config.json setting called "TeamNameplateDistance" that lets you reduce the distance at which team names are drawn, with the default being 2000. Reducing the number of Team Nameplates on screen in MP can improve performance, so this can be used as needed.

III. Bug Fixes:
	Fixed an issue where the World Menu seed button was still hidden
	Fixed an issue where sometimes players would get an extremely long death timer. The maximum should now be limited to 30 seconds. This should retroactively fix characters with an extremely high death timer.

	Demon Altars can no longer spawn on rare configurations of adjacent cacti, which would crash the world if they were hit

	New Set Bonus: Titanium Barrier
	As you attack enemies, titanium shards accumulate and spin around you
	These shards deal damage to enemies at close range, and inflict knockback.
	Use them defensively to keep enemies away, or for the bold, aggressively to inflict extra damage.

	Hallowed Set
	New Set Bonus: Holy Protection
	Familiar to most users as Shadow Dodge, Hallowed has had its previously stat-based set bonus replaced with a periodic immunity to damage.
	Upon attacking an enemy, you will gain a buff. If an enemy hits you during this buff, you will gain a very brief immunity to damage.
	After this period of immunity, at least 30 seconds must pass before you can re-activate the immunity buff.

	Each piece of the set now gives 1 HP/s regen
	Instead of 30% damage reduction whenever you have charges, you now have 12% damage reduction at all times, and 20% additional damage reduction while charges are active. In practice, this is roughly equivalent to the same 30% it used to give due to how the two values are multiplied.
	Recharge time between shield charges reduced by 1 second

	Stardust Armor
	Stardust Guardian now has a more much vigorous and aggressive attack, and he will attack automatically without prompting. All resemblance to a certain anime is purely coincidental.

	Shortswords
	Shortswords can now be used in all directions, not just forward
	Gold Shortsword damage increased from 11 to 12

	Flails
	Flails now have entirely new behavior, and a few different functionality modes.
	If you click and hold the mouse button, they will swing around rapidly, doing low knock back and hitting rapidly in a small circle around you.
	If you click and use them normally, you will shoot them forward similar to how they use to be used, but they will move much faster than they did before. The damage dealt is double in this mode.
	Finally, if you click while it is in midair after having shot it forward, it will drop suddenly and lay on the ground. This can be used as a stationary damaging obstacle like a Spiky Ball on enemies walking towards you.
	Some flails have had some stat tweaks to fit with this new setup, such as having slightly longer or shorter range, but generally speaking, all of them should perform better than before.

	Poison Staff
	Note: Previously, due to piercing immunity frames, only one projectile from each shot would hit each target, resulting in a lot of lost damage. We've implemented a system that allows ALL of the projectiles to hit a target, dramatically improving its shotgun-like functionality. However, to offset this gain, it has had to have some of its stats reduced. On the whole, this should now be a stronger weapon, however.

	When enemies are in range, it will constantly attack any nearby enemies, consuming mana for each attack.
	Can hit up to 3 targets with each attack (does not consume extra mana)
	Damage is now set to 40
	Mana cost has been decreased from 18 to 15, however, it can now fire up to 4 times per second, increasing the speed at which it consumes mana

	Reduced number of enemies that each projectile can hit from 7 to 5
	Applies a 25% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy a projectile pierces
	Now has a range before projectiles die, 50% longer than Poison Staff's

	Wasp Gun
	Note: This may sound like a nerf on paper, but it trades "hit count" for total damage, and will actually result in dramatically more DPS for the Wasp Gun. Less Wasps, more damage.
	Damage increased from 21 to 31
	Use Time increased from 11 to 18
	Wasps can now bounce/pierce only 3 times instead of 4
	Wasps per Cast: Reduced to an average of 3
	Mana cost increased from 6 to 10

	Nettle Burst
	Damage increased from 28 to 35

	Damage decreased from 72 to 65
	Each projectile can now hit up to 3 times, rather than only once

	Use Time decreased from 16 to 10
	Can no longer pierce and hit multiple enemies

	For the next two seconds, you will fire 3 total piercing blasts, each dealing a base damage of 250 (up from 100)
	After this, it will shoot the laser beam, which is unchanged from the original implementation
	You can also quick-fire pellets without charging. The fire rate of these pellets is much higher than the previous implementation.
	The mana cost of charging is unchanged, however, quick firing will naturally consume more mana as the fire rate has increased significantly.

	Nebula Blaze
	Use Time decreased from 15 to 12
	Mana cost decreased from 18 to 12

G. Summons:
	Summoned minions now adjust their damage dynamically based on your current equipment and damage buffs

	"Some (though not all) Summons now use their own damage immunity timer system. In practice, what this means is that they will no longer interfere with the use of other weapons by maxing out the enemy's immunity frames. All affected minions are set on their own damage timer to most correctly match their pre-change DPS, but some changes are to be expected comparing 1.3.5 DPS to 1.4 DPS. In general, even if there is some minor loss or gain of DPS compared to pre-change performance, it should be worth the improvement to overall performance. Examples of minions impacted by this change:
	- Slime Staff
	- Spider Staff
	- Pirate Staff
	- Optic Staff
	- Raven Staff
	- Deadly Sphere Staff
	- Stardust Dragon Staff
	- Some of the new summons also utilize this system"

	Raven Staff
	Damage increased from 37 to 55

	Titan Glove and its tinkers now give autoswing to all Melee Weapons (and Whips!)

	Wing Balance has been heavily balanced across the entirety of the game.
	With only a few exceptions, wings found at the same tier should be roughly equivalent in power. Exceptions are usually particularly hard or particularly easy to get.
	Unfortunately, its difficult to share exact stats for wings, partially because there are dozens of them that have been changed, and their stats don't easily translate to easily readable stats.
	The best short summary is that over a dozen sets of wings were buffed, and that Leaf and Frozen Wings have been reduced in power, as they were too strong for their tier.
	Other major notes:
	- Butterfly and Bee Wings can now only drop after the Mech Bosses, but their power has been increased proportionally.
	- Previously, most wings from Wall of Flesh until Golem were very similar in power, and didn't offer a lot of reason to upgrade. These have now been spread out, creating a more gradual, consistent increase in wing power across the course of the game.


	Shrimpy Truffle now gives its increased speed and damage bonus when in the rain.
	Basilisk Mount now has a double jump

J. Tools and Mining:
	All axes, hamaxes, chainsaws and other tools with axe-functionality have their wood cutting speed increased by 20%
	All drills and chainsaws now dig faster than their non-mechanical counterparts, but have shorter range. Additionally, optimized digging loadouts still perform better on pickaxes/axes, but drills and chainsaws will be faster on non-optimized loadouts
	Desert Fossil can now be mined at any pickaxe power or with bombs. However, it is fragile and adjacent fossil blocks may break when you mine it, costing you some of the ore.
	Desert Fossil based gear is now weaker because it is available sooner.
	Hellforges now require Demonite Pickaxe or higher to break. They also now protect the tiles below them from being broken while in the Underworld. This does not apply outside of the Underworld.

	Use Time decreased from 16 to 15
	Damage decreased from 5 to 4

	Bone Pickaxe

K. Buffs, Debuffs and Potions:
	A substantial number of Buff Potions have had their durations increased, many as much as twice as long
	The Well Fed buff has been divided into three tiers, with the lowest tier being equal to the original, and the strongest being 2x as strong as the original
	All of the Food in the game, including the 50+ new Food items, have had their durations and tiers adjusted to have a more consistent reward for the difficulty of obtaining them. Short duration foods might have a higher tier, while long duration foods might have a lower tier. Find what is most efficient for you!
	Well Fed Buff now gives a mining speed bonus
	Invisibility Potion now has an added benefit of reducing enemy spawn rates by 20%
	Restoration Potions no longer heal mana, but heal 10 more life for a total of 90, and induce even less Potion Sickness, now only 45 seconds

	Cursed Inferno Debuff
	Damage per second increased from 12 to 24 on both player and enemy versions of the debuff
	Ghoul, Clinger, and Spazmatism Cursed Inferno duration decreased somewhat to mitigate the increased danger to the player
	All other sources of this debuff are intended recipients of the improved damage

	Venom Debuff
	Damage per second increased from 12 to 30 on both player and enemy versions of the debuff
	Pygmy and Queen Spider Staff Venom duration decreased to mitigate the increased potency
	Black Recluse and Sand Poacher Venom duration decreased somewhat to mitigate the increased danger to the player
	All other sources of this debuff are intended recipients of the improved damage

L. Fishing:

Minions with line of sight on that enemy will target it immediately. However, if the minions do not have line of sight, they will continue to attack targets at random.
	The way Sentry Summons function has been changed somewhat.
		Outside of the DD2 Invasion event, you now have a limit of one sentry summon at a time
		Some of the 1.3.4 content can increase this limit
		Unlike before, when the sentry limit is above 1, you can summon multiple versions of the same sentry. For instance, with a sentry limit of 3, you could summon 3 Frost Hydras at the same time.
	Weve added an experimental new seed feature to World generation. All worlds generated in 1.3.4 and beyond will have a seed attached to them. You will also be able to set the seed for a world on world generation. PLEASE NOTE that this feature is not active by default. To activate it, please follow these steps:
		Find Terrarias config.json file. On Windows, this should be found in Documents>My Games>Terraria.
		Open the config file with a basic text editing program, such as Notepad.
		The 12th line in the config file is labeled EUseExperimentalFeatures" and will be set to falseE
		Simply change this to trueEand save the config.json file. The next time you launch Terraria, the option to view and set world seeds will appear.
	Please be aware that this is NOT a retroactive feature, and cannot display the seeds for worlds created before 1.3.4, as the data is simply not stored there.
